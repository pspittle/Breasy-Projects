      Welcome to iCan.
      <br><br>
      iCan provides on-the-go information on the Firmâ€™s Engagement Independence policies and guidance.
      <br><br>
      iCan will assist in:
      <ul>
        <li>deciding which non-audit services may be offered to KPMG audit clients; and

      </ul>
      iCan is intended to provide general guidance only and should be read in conjunction with the policies
      and guidance on non-audit services detailed in the Quality and Risk Management Manual.
